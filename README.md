# R-Studio-Project
R language Project/Application+Data Analysis/Analysing ways and conditions in which road accidents happen and finding ways to prevent them from happening again in the future.


In this project i have only used R language and R Studio program to generate the data analysis and also to develop a simple application.
The application is located in app1 folder.
The data i have used for this entire project has been official data provided by a webpage called INSTAT and i have collected every data from there about accidents in Albania.
There is also a pdf file in which i have included a long statistical analysis of the gathered data,using here multiple methods of analysis.
For the graphs generated i have used essquisse package,all you need to do is install it on your R Studio program, this allows you to make aesthetically pleasing graphs 
with the help of a simple website in which you can personalize your own graphs.The rest are just statistical methods that i have used such as linear regresion.
There is also an Excel spreadsheet with all the data included i have named the file as Excelpermbledhes(i'm sorry this project was all written in albanian as it was a 
project i worked on during my second year of university).
